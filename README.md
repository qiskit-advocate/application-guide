# Qiskit Advocates Application Guide

*New: 2023 application details have been announced! Please check out the [How you can apply](#how-you-can-apply) section.*

## What is the Qiskit Advocate program?
The Qiskit Advocate program is a global initiative to support the most active members of the Qiskit community and Qiskit ecosystem. As an Advocate, you will join the most passionate group of people in quantum computing. Since the program was in 2020, [more than 400 people with diverse backgrounds from over 45 countries have joined](https://qiskit.org/advocates/). We work together to grow the Qiskit community through organizing events, making open source contributions to Qiskit code, creating educational content, and more.

## Why you should apply

### 1. Networking with experts and enthusiasts
As an Advocate, you will be able to attend monthly meetup sessions to share projects and ideas and work together with fellow advocates on new projects and events.

### 2. Getting special access to Qiskit core members and projects
As an Advocate, you will be able to ask questions to members of the Qiskit team and find a mentor through our [mentorship program](http://qisk.it/advocate-mentorship).

### 3. Being recognized by IBM
As an Advocate, you will have the opportunity to have your work supported and highlighted by IBM.

### 4. Receiving invitations to events
As an active Advocate, you will be invited to global (physical or virtual) events created for the quantum community such as Qiskit Camps and IBM Quantum Challenges.

## Who can apply?
We welcome anyone who is enthusiastic about quantum computing and eager to grow the Qiskit community and Qiskit ecosystem.

## How you can apply

Here are the steps for applying to become an Advocate:

*Note: dates are not final and may be subject to change*

1. **Make contributions to Qiskit code and community (Deadline: Jul 1, 2023)**
Community contributions can vary depending on individual interests including code, tutorials, textbook chapters, bug reporting, Slack support, blogs, videos, events, and more. See the [Contributions](#contributions) section below for different types of contributions that you could make. All contributions must be made before Jul 1, 2023 and submitted as part of your application. 
2. **Submit Application Form (Jun 1 - Jul 1, 2023)**
Applications must be submitted no later than Jul 1, 2023, 11:59 p.m. EDT. Click "Join the program" on the Qiskit Advocate website: https://qiskit.org/advocates/ to apply.
3. **Take the Qiskit Developer Certification test (Deadline: Jul 15, 2023)**
Passing Qiskit Developer Certification test is one of the requirements for becoming a Qiskit Advocate and if you ave not yet completed this exam, then you will have an additional 2 weeks to do so. The exam is proctored and will need to be scheduled, so please keep this in mind when submitting your materials and give yourself plenty of time and apply early! You can get a voucher to take the test once you have submitted an appropriate* application for the Qiskit Advcocate program. See the [Test](#test) section below for more details.
4. **Application review (Jul 15 - Aug 15, 2023)** 
Applications will be reviewed by the Qiskit Advocate squad on a rolling basis. All application requirements, excluding the Qiskit Developer Certification test, must be finished by Jul 1, 2023 at 11:59 p.m. EDT. 
Applicants will have until July 15, 2023 to pass the Qiskit Developer Certification test.

* An appropriate application is one which has been completed with intent to join the Qiskit Advocate program and not submitted merely to obtain an exam voucher.  Receiving a voucher from your application does not mean you have been selected as a Qiskit Advocate.

## Test

The [Qiskit Developer Certification](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2021/03/quantum-developer-certification/) is used to assess your technical competency of Qiskit. You can find exam format, scope and resources on [the official website](https://www.ibm.com/training/certification/C0010300). You can read more [here](https://medium.com/qiskit/learn-more-about-the-ibm-quantum-developer-certification-and-how-to-take-it-for-free-d237f9765dc5) about how to prepare for the test. Join the [#qiskit-cert-exam](https://qiskit.slack.com/archives/C0272SW2L0H) channel in the [Qiskit Slack workspace](https://ibm.co/joinqiskitslack) to find even more learning resources, ask questions and interact with others who are also interested in taking the test.

**Vouchers:** Those submitting a 2023 application to the Qiskit Advocate program and have not passed the Qiskit Developer Certification will be eligble for a voucher.  These will be supplied only after submitting an application.

## Contributions

Here are some examples of contributions we consider valuable for the community. Tier 1 > Tier 2 > Tier 3 > Tier 4 in terms of significance.

Both quantity and quality of contributions will be examined by us. For example, if you have been very active on Slack and answered many questions/participated in many meaningful discussions, these contributions will be considered higher importance than just answering two or three questions. On the other hand, a PR fixing a critical bug or adding a new feature to Qiskit will be considered more important than a few PRs fixing typos of Qiskit textbook chapters. Each submitted contribution will be scored by the application reviewers. You must score at least 20 points to be considered for the program. Below are examples of some common contributions and the anticipated range of points we attribute to those contributions. This rubric gives guidance to the applicant, but is not exhaustive and may not cover every type of contribution and scores may vary in exceptional circumstances.
